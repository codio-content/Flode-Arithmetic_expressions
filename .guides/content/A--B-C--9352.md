This challenge introduces the use of *parentheses* (brackets) to perform more complex mathematical expressions.

It is actually very logical and follows the exact same rules as when you write expressions mathematically on paper.

Here's an example calculation that uses parentheses...

```javascript
result = x * (y - 2)
```

This is obviously not the same as 

```javascript
result = x * y - 2
```

So hopefully you can see why it is important to use brackets.
