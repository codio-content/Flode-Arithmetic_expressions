Before we start with a series of challenges, we will explain the basics of creating expressions.

In the challenges, you will be presented with a chart on the left with one or more inputs already present with some test data.

## The Output block
In all of these challenges, you should use the Output block to enter your expressions.

This calculates the expression and sends the result directly to the output window.

## Run the chart
Go ahead and step through the chart so you can see how it works. 

## Changing the test data
You should experiment changing the test data to see how your chart works with different values.
