As you create your Flode charts, you are very likely to make mistakes. 

The Undo feature is important for rescuing yourself from unintended actions, so please be sure to remember these commands as they are only available with hotkey combinations.

## Undo
To undo your most recent edit 

- PC users press Ctrl+Z
- Mac users press Cmd+Z

You can press this combination several times to go back several edits.

## Redo
Redo changes back any undo operations you may have done. If you have not just pressed Undo then Redo will have no effect.

To redo your most recent edit 

- PC users press Ctrl+Shift+Z
- Mac users press Cmd+Shift+Z

You can press this combination several times.
