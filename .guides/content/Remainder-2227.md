Let's take the following example ...

$$ \dfrac {20}{6} = 3 \space remainder \space 2 $$

In Flode, let's say you have a variable `X` and you want to divide it by `6`. You write this as

```javascript
X % 6
```

Let's say that instead of `X` we use an input. In this case, we would write it as 

```javascript
input0 % 6
```

Take note of this for the challenge below.
