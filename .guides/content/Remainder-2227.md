Let's take the following example ...

$$ \dfrac {20}{6} = 3 \space remainder \space 2 $$

In Flode, you would find the remainder of 20 divided by 6 like this.

```javascript
20 % 6
```

Let's say that instead of `20` we used an input. In this case, we would write it as 

```javascript
input0 % 6
```

Armed with this information, try this challenge.
