For all of the challenges you need to set your chart up in the right way. 

Here is a brief reminder of the correct way to do this.

## Challenge format
In the challenges, we will usually start the instructions like this ...

> We will provide you with two inputs ....

You will also find an instruction ...

> Output the result ...

## Inputs
Where we specify inputs, you should have one or more input boxes at the start of your chart. 

The example on the left has 2 inputs, but many have only 1. For each input expected, be sure to have an individual input. The first one will be labelled `input0`, the second `input1` etc.

## Outputs
Where we specify outputs (in most cases the challenge expects just one output but there could be more), be sure to use the Output block as shown in the Flode chart on the left.

## Running the chart
Running the chart is very important to testing your logic.

The Step and Stop buttons are the ones you will be using most. Run runs without stopping.
